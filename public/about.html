<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! I'm a beginner web developer. I have no previous coding experience. In fact, I had to learn general knowledge about 
computers and the internet alone. I have adhd so traditional schooling was always hard for me. I like to learn at my own pace, which is 
usually pretty fast, and taking the general education classes are quite boring. I want to get right to it. So I've decided to take on 
this new learning journey to better myself, gain new skills, and hopefully start a career in web development.</p>
