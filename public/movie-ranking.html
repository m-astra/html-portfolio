<h1>The Best Movies According to Morgan</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Carol</h3>
<p>It's so artfully done. The subtle queer moments throughout that normally would go unmissed by a straight person is just so realistic. Also who doesn't love Cate Blanchette, Rooney Mara, and Sarah Paulson all in one film.</p>
<h3>Sweeney Todd</h3>
<p>I love the dreary styling of the film. The dark humor is also something I enjoy. And anything Helena Bonhem Carter is in, I'll watch.</p>
<h3>Coraline</h3>
<p>I love Tim Burton films. The styling is very nostalgic, and I just love stop motion.</p>
